Ingredients:
For the Dough:
2 ¼ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast
1 ½ cups warm water (110°F or 45°C)
3 ½ - 4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
For the Pizza Sauce:
1 cup tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch of sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
Toppings (optional and customizable):
1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese (shredded)
Pepperoni slices
Fresh basil leaves
Mushrooms, onions, olives, bell peppers, or any toppings of your choice
Instructions:
1. Make the Dough:
In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 ½ cups flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1 ½ hours until doubled in size.
2. Prepare the Sauce:
In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
Stir in tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. Assemble the Pizza:
Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).
Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two portions (for two pizzas). Roll out each portion into a round shape on a floured surface.
Transfer the rolled dough onto a pizza stone or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Spread a layer of the prepared pizza sauce over the dough.
Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top, then add your preferred toppings.
4. Bake:
Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and melted.
For an extra crispy crust, you can bake it directly on the bottom rack of the oven.
5. Garnish and Serve:
Once out of the oven, garnish with fresh basil leaves or drizzle some olive oil. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
